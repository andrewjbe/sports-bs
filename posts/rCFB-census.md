# What is this?

As a side project, I decided to scrape every comment from every game
thread this season. I decided to use the data to do a “r/CFB census” to
see what I could learn about the different fanbases, and I posted the
first update
[here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16srlyr/cfb_flair_census_update_scraping_every_game/)
earlier in the season. Now that we’re getting into the latter half, I
thought I’d post another update.

# The data

So far, I’ve scraped 827 game threads with 1,277,330 total comments. I
actually also have the post game threads as well, which expands the
total number of comments to 1,439,198, but for now I’m just going to
focus on the game threads. If you want to see what this post would look
like if I included the PGTs too, you can see that [here]().

Here’s a fun graph that shows how many comments people left per hour
throughout the whole season: [GRAPH: comments per hour]()

Here’s a table with the top ten game threads so far this year by total
comments. Colorado seems to be popular for some reason, not sure why.

| Rank | Thread                    | Total Comments |
|:-----|:--------------------------|:---------------|
| #1   | Colorado State @ Colorado | 52,055         |
| #2   | Penn State @ Ohio State   | 32,793         |
| #3   | Colorado @ Oregon         | 28,412         |

| #10  | Colorado @ TCU            | 23,449         |

This time, I also added up the total number of comments in all of each
team’s game threads this year in order to find the most talked-about
team on r/CFB this year. The top team will absolutely shock you!

Colorado has had exactly one (1) game thread so far with less than 15k
comments (@ ASU). Here is their full slate thus far:

# r/CFB flair census

The first question I wanted to answer was “how big is each fanbase?” To
determine this, I took every username that left a comment in a game
thread this year, and classified them by their most recent primary
flair. Also, just to save space, I cut it off at flairs with 50+ unique
users. Feel free to ask if you’re curious about a smaller school’s
numbers.

The first table here shows the results, sorted by total unique users:

## Most ref complaints per comment

I used a similar approach for this, scanning each comment for words
indicating a ref complaint. This isn’t perfect, because it misses
vaguely worded things like “oh, come on” and can include some false
positives like “the refs are doing a great job and I love them”, but
it’s close enough to do the job. Includes variations of terms like
“refs” (including “referees”, “refball”, etc.), “officials”, “flag”,
“whistle”, “the fix”, “rig”, etc. I also limited this to include only
flairs with at least 2,500 total comments in the dataset.

BikiniATroll maintains a comfortable lead, as the only poster to break
2k, and is on pace to close out the victory unless someone steps up.
Special shoutout to leakymemo for the impressive swear rate.

This is still anyone’s game!

# Special research question – why are you so obsessed with us?

I got a few requests to get some numbers on how specific rivalries
manifest in game threads. Specifically, USC / OU fans and Notre Dame /
LSU fans wanted to know who was showing up to the others’ game threads
to talk shit more often.

I decided to calculate this with comments “per capita”, i.e. looking at
all of each team’s game threads and finding the flair which left the
most comments per unique users in the census. I’ve filtered out comments
from non-neutrals and the unflaired, and also limited it to just flairs
with at least 50 unique users.

As the data shows, OU fans are the #1 most common neutral commentator in
USC threads, whether you go by comments per capita or just raw totals.
However, USC fans hardly ever show up in OU threads by comparison – they
don’t make the top ten, and you actually have to go all the way down to
#30 to find them.

Thus, we can conclude that the hate seems to flow pretty clearly in one
direction. This also probably has something to do with the relative
success the teams have had this year (there’s been more occasion for OU
fans to pile onto USC so far than vice versa), but I think this is
pretty conclusive proof that the OU / USC rivalry is largely one-sided,
at least on this sub.

## LSU vs. Notre Dame

Here are the top 10 most common commenters in LSU threads:

Notre Dame does show up on LSU’s list, at #6 by comments per capita or
#3 for total comments. So while it’s not quite as strong as OU’s hate,
they definitely still seem to have some raw feelings toward ol’ Cajun
Kelly. LSU doesn’t show up on here until #35 on the list, so like USC,
they don’t really seem to be reciprocating.

I hope you found this interesting! I’m going to keep this going for the
rest of the season, so please let me know if there’s anything else you’d
like me to track. Thanks for reading!
