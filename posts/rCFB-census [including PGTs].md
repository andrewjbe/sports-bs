# What is this?

As a side project, I decided to scrape every comment from every game
thread this season. I decided to use the data to do a “r/CFB census” to
see what I could learn about the different fanbases, and I posted the
first update
[here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/16srlyr/cfb_flair_census_update_scraping_every_game/)
earlier in the season. Now that we’re getting into the latter half, I
thought I’d post another update.

# The data

So far, I’ve scraped 827 game threads with 1,277,330 total comments. I
actually also have the post game threads as well, which expands the
total number of comments to 1,439,198, but for now I’m just going to
focus on the game threads. If you want to see what this post would look
like if I included the PGTs too, you can see that [here]().

Here’s a fun graph that shows how many comments people left per hour
throughout the whole season: [GRAPH: comments per hour]()

Here’s a table with the top ten game threads so far this year by total
comments. Colorado seems to be popular for some reason, not sure why.

| Rank | Thread                    | Total Comments |
|:-----|:--------------------------|:---------------|
| #1   | Colorado State @ Colorado | 52,055         |
| #2   | Penn State @ Ohio State   | 32,793         |
| #3   | Colorado @ Oregon         | 28,412         |

| #10  | Colorado @ TCU            | 23,449         |

This time, I also added up the total number of comments in all of each
team’s game threads this year in order to find the most talked-about
team on r/CFB this year. The top team will absolutely shock you!

Colorado has had exactly one (1) game thread so far with less than 15k
comments (@ ASU). Here is their full slate thus far:

# r/CFB flair census

The first question I wanted to answer was “how big is each fanbase?” To
determine this, I took every username that left a comment in a game
thread this year, and classified them by their most recent primary
flair. Also, just to save space, I cut it off at flairs with 50+ unique
users. Feel free to ask if you’re curious about a smaller school’s
numbers.

The first table here shows the results, sorted by total unique users:

I used a similar approach for this, scanning each comment for words
indicating a ref complaint. This isn’t perfect, because it misses
vaguely worded things like “oh, come on” and can include some false
positives like “the refs are doing a great job and I love them”, but
it’s close enough to do the job. Includes variations of terms like
“refs” (including “referees”, “refball”, etc.), “officials”, “flag”,
“whistle”, “the fix”, “rig”, etc. I also limited this to include only
flairs with at least 2,500 total comments in the dataset.

BikiniATroll maintains a comfortable lead, as the only poster to break
2k, and is on pace to close out the victory unless someone steps up.
Special shoutout to leakymemo for the impressive swear rate.
