# Intro

As a little side project, I decided to scrape every comment from every game thread and post game thread this season. I've done this here and there in the past, like with March Madness game threads and last year's bowl season, but I've never done it over a whole season before. I've got my setup fully automated to scrape every thread with "[Game Thread]" or "[Post Game Thread]" in the title at 4AM every night, and the test run over the first few weeks has been a success so far. So I thought it would be fun to share what I've got so far, and possibly provide updates every few weeks until the end of the season.
